* jmatrix - j's matrix

jmatrix is a WIP [[https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix][uMatrix]] implementation for qutebrowser. It operates on uMatrix
style config files, to make switching easier.

It tries to mirror uMatrix's behavior as close as possible. If you find a
discrepancy that's not accounted for, please let me know.
